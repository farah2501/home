**Project Description**
<p> We chose a Tourism theme for this project. For this particular task, our group has come to an agreement to start a mock organization. MYTour is a tourism organization which aims to provide a platform for travel deals sites offering bustling and picturesque attractions in Malaysia. In relation to Sustainable Goal Development, Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, we have decided to create a platform where everyone is able to know sightseeing tours, attractions, excursions, things to do, fun activities and holiday packages around Malaysia as our motto is “Welcome to Malaysia”. </p>

Our website consists of five main pages which are home, about us, destination, booking, and contact. We have chosen two main fonts which are roboto and lexend deca. The whole concept for this website is simple and basic yet fresh and straight-to-the-point for easy navigation to all users. The background colour is soft pink and the elements used are colourized with colours like dark blue, dark gray, yellow, and red to compliment the website color.

For the organization flow, we have several steps in managing our organization. Firstly, we allow the user to choose either to register or not. The users can search the destination along with their check-in and check-out date in the homepage. Also, we manage our destination part by allowing users to search any destinations or activities to allow them to explore more about the specific places. The user can book  places that they desire to visit from the page of places they choose before.

Our website also provides a booking page which can be easily used for people especially for the one that already planned their destination to book quickly with the deals and packages provided. Further step in completing the booking part is entering the details like package type and quantity. After that, the users must make sure to do a confirmation about the accuracy of the details filled in the booking page. The steps mentioned above must be followed accordingly in order for the booking to be approved.
